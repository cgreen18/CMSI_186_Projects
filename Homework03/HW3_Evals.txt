Files in Git      : all three present                 - 0.67 point
Test Harness      : ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at
                       DiceSet.java line 143          - 0.75 point
HighRoll          : passes all evaluation tests       - 0 points

Total 18.42 out of 30 = 61.4% which is an D

Sorry to have to give such a low score -- I know you can do better than
this, Conor...  the low evaluation is because there were no tests in
your Die.java or DiceSet.java file, and the fact that you had no HighRoll
file hurt a LOT.

If you are having trouble for any reason with this stuff, please don't
hesitate to drop by my office during office hours or during the HOPE
session on Wednesdays at noon in the regular class room [Keck Annex].
